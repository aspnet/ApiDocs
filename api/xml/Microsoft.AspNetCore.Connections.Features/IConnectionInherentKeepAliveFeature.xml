    <summary>
            Indicates if the connection transport has an "inherent keep-alive", which means that the transport will automatically
            inform the client that it is still present.
            </summary>
    <remarks>
            The most common example of this feature is the Long Polling HTTP transport, which must (due to HTTP limitations) terminate
            each poll within a particular interval and return a signal indicating "the server is still here, but there is no data yet".
            This feature allows applications to add keep-alive functionality, but limit it only to transports that don't have some kind
            of inherent keep-alive.
            </remarks>
