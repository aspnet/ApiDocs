<Namespace Name="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication">
  <Docs>
    <summary>Contains types that enable support for authentication. <see cref="T:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.IAuthenticationService" /> is the main entry point which defines the 5 authentication actions: Authenticate (get any authentication data for a request), Challenge (used for unauthenticated requests), Forbid (used when an authenticated request should be denied), SignIn (associate a ClaimsPrincipal), SignOut (remove any associated data). At a high level, authentication is based around the concept of schemes, which are mapped to specific <see cref="T:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.IAuthenticationHandler" /> instances which are responsible for handling each of the authentication actions.</summary>
