<Namespace Name="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints">
  <Docs>
    <summary>Provides types that are used to apply route constraints. Route constraints generally inspect the route value associated via the route template and make a true or false decision about whether the value is acceptable. Custom route constraints can be created by implementing <see cref="T:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.IRouteConstraint" /> and registering them with the app's <see cref="M:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteOptions.ConstraintMap" />.</summary>
